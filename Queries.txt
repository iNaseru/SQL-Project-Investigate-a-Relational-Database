Question Set (1)

Question 1:
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

SELECT
    c.name AS category_name,
    COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
FROM
    film_category AS fc
    JOIN category AS c ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
    JOIN film AS f ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
    JOIN inventory AS i ON i.film_id = f.film_id
    JOIN rental AS r ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
WHERE
    c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY
    category_name
ORDER BY
    category_name;

Question 3:
Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:

    Category
    Rental length category
    Count

SELECT
    sub.name,
    sub.standard_quartile,
    COUNT(sub.standard_quartile)
FROM (
    SELECT
        f.title,
        c.name,
        f.rental_duration,
        ntile(4)
        OVER (
        ORDER BY
            f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
    FROM
        film_category AS fc
        JOIN category AS c ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
        JOIN film AS f ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
    WHERE
        c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')) AS sub
GROUP BY
    sub.name,
    sub.standard_quartile
ORDER BY
    sub.name,
    sub.standard_quartile;

Question Set (2)

Question 1:
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

SELECT
    date_part('month', r.rental_date) AS Rental_month,
    date_part('year', r.rental_date) AS Rental_year,
    se.store_id AS Store_ID,
    count(*) AS Count_rentals
FROM
    store AS se
    JOIN staff AS sf ON se.store_id = sf.store_id
    JOIN rental AS r ON sf.staff_id = r.staff_id
GROUP BY
    Rental_month,
    Rental_year,
    se.store_id
ORDER BY
    Count_rentals DESC;

Question 2:
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?

SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', p.payment_date) AS pay_month,
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS fullname,
    COUNT(p.amount) AS pay_countpermon,
    SUM(p.amount) AS pay_amount
FROM
    customer AS c
    JOIN payment AS p ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name)
    IN (
        SELECT
            sub.fullname
        FROM (
            SELECT
                CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS fullname,
                SUM(p.amount) AS amount_total
            FROM
                customer AS c
                JOIN payment AS p ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
            GROUP BY
                fullname
            ORDER BY
                amount_total DESC
            LIMIT 10) AS sub)
    AND (p.payment_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01'
        AND '2008-01-01')
GROUP BY
    pay_month,
    fullname
ORDER BY
    fullname,
    pay_month,
    pay_countpermon;
